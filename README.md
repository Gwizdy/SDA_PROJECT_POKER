# POKER_TEXAS_HOLDEM

This application was created in JAVA by Andrzej Pigulak and Paweł Gwizdała as first project in Software Development Academy course. It is designed for multiplayer game from two to eight players, where players take turns. Application uses:

- JAVA Swing to display graphical interface.
- JDBC to store table with 5 highest winning player polls by descending order and hand combination.

Graphics and mechanisms was created to reflect Poker Texas Holdem game with friends in home environment, instead of casino climat. In-game instructions are conducted in polish language, however it maintains english Poker callouts. Blinds are raising twice every second card deal.
